# Event Manager Company - User Management API

Welcome to the **Event Manager Company** onboarding project prepared by Yarlina Yepez Cuesta!  
This FastAPI-based secure REST API provides robust user management features, including registration, login, user profile updates, and authentication via JWT token-based OAuth2.  
It also serves as the foundation for future event management and registration capabilities that will be used for next project: *The final*

## ‚ú® Reflection

Throughout this assignment, I strengthened my skills in various areas of coding and issue resolution. Some of the areas I practice and improved are FastAPI development, REST API security, automated testing with Pytest, and collaborative GitHub workflows.  
I learned the importance of thorough test coverage, how to debug token-based auth issues, and how to customize documentation for usability. Specifically, I gained a better understanding of reading the code, finding where the issue is and understanding what the code is asking to do.

A major takeaway was fixing the 403 access bug tied to user roles and realizing how critical and important dependency injection and test fixtures are in complex backend systems. Out of all the issues encounteered, I can say this was the most tidious for me as I had to go back to various test files to ensure that the 403 and 401 were correctly used.  
I also gained hands-on experience enhancing Swagger UI, a skill that will be especially useful when developing and testing APIs in real-world environments and that I look forward to experimenting with.
